# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML
A Python-based machine learning project to predict heart disease risk using clinical data. The project involves data analysis, model building, and insights into key health factors contributing to heart failure. Visualizations and trends across different countries are also explored.


💻 Heart Disease Prediction Model: A Data Science Project Using Python 🩺

I’m thrilled to share my recent data science project where I worked on building a predictive model to assess the risk of heart disease using a dataset containing clinical and health data. This project was not only technically challenging but also impactful, addressing one of the leading causes of death globally—heart disease.



🔍 Project Name: Heart Disease Mortality Prediction

Given the dataset of patients' clinical information, including parameters like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, our goal was to:

- Predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using machine learning techniques.

- Identify key influencers in developing heart conditions.

- Compare heart disease trends across countries with the highest mortality rates.



📂 Data & Project Details:

- We used 14 features from the original dataset, including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, to predict the target variable (whether a patient has heart disease or not).

- We built regression models to predict heart disease, tested them on random patients from the dataset, and compared their performance with actual data.

- Additionally, we used global data to compare the trends in heart disease mortality in three countries where cardiovascular-related deaths are most prevalent.



🛠️ Tech Stack:

- Python for data cleaning, analysis, and model building

- Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for machine learning models, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

- Jupyter Notebook to run and document the analysis

- Visualizations and insights were compiled into a presentation using PowerPoint.



📊 Key Insights:

Top Risk Factors:

- Patients with high serum creatinine had a 136% increased likelihood of mortality.

- High blood pressure was linked to a 28% higher risk of heart disease.

- Anemia also increased mortality risk by 26%.



Accuracy of the Predictive Model:

- The model correctly predicted death with a 95% probability for high-risk patients.

- For low-risk patients, the model estimated an 18% probability of death, which aligned closely with actual outcomes.



Country Trends:

- We found that cardiovascular-related deaths increased significantly between 1980 and 2021, with Nuru, Egypt, and Afghanistan being the top three countries with the highest death rates.



📈 Real-World Impact: 

This project offers real-world applications in healthcare by identifying high-risk patients early, which can lead to personalized treatment plans, improved patient outcomes, and cost reduction for healthcare systems. Early intervention and resource optimization are critical in combating heart disease effectively.
